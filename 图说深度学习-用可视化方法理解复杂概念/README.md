## All the notebooks!

Many figures in the book were created using Python programs.
Almost all of these were developed in Jupyter notebooks,
and those are included here.

Since the purpose of the notebooks was to make figures, 
rather than to
serve as tutorials, they are only lightly commented. 
But I did want them to be readable if you wanted to see
how I built a certain system, or made a particular image.
So I tried to 
choose clear variable names, and whenever I could I
preferred clarity over most other concerns. This means
that much of the code can be shortened, 
reorganized or otherwise refactored,
and almost always it can be changed to be
more compact, elegant, and faster. Feel free
to dig in, optimize, convert to other languages, or otherwise play with the code.  

All the notebooks are released under the MIT license. Informally, you're free to 
do pretty much anything with the code, including using it in your own projects,
or even including it in commercial projects, as long as you keep my copyright
along with the code. While I strove for accuracy and correctness, there is no 
warranty that the code is bug-free or fit for any purpose.

Some notebooks work with images. The images I used in the book are included
with the notebooks. See the section below on Figures for details on their
licensing, and see the book for the URL where each image may be found. All images
without an explicit citation in the book are by the author, and are released
under the MIT license.

## Have Fun!
