# Current Errata

## Chapter 3

**Page 63**

A small stylistic issue: The summation symbol at the bottom currently shows $\sum_{i=1}$ but should be either $\sum_{i}$ or $\sum_{i=1}^{n}$.

**Page 66**

The doc strings of the LogisticRegressionGD classifier reference "Mean squared error loss" -- this is a copy-paste error and should be "Log loss".

**Page 84**

A larger gamma value should create a smaller (not larger) radius.

## Chapter 11

**Page 341**

Add bias unit to the net input.

**Page 354**

The MSE is normalized via `mse = mse/i` but should be normalized via `mse = mse/(i+1)` instead. (This does not affect the results in shown below though. The MSE is still 0.3.)

**Page 366**

It says $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{1,1}^{(\text {out })}} = ...$ but should be $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{1,1}^{(\text {h })}}$ to match the figure above and text below.

**Page 361**

$\frac{\partial}{\partial w_{j, l}^{(l)}}=L(\boldsymbol{W}, \boldsymbol{b})$ should be $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{j, l}^{(l)}}$



## Chapter 12

**Page 380**

We use `TensorDataset` even though we defined the custom `JointDataset`

## Chapter 14

**Page 459**

The `conv1d()` and `conv2d()` functions on page 459 was improved through a kind [pull request](https://github.com/rasbt/machine-learning-book/pull/168) by [@JaGeo](https://github.com/JaGeo), enabling it to handle cases with strides different from (1,1).

## Chapter 13

**Page 431**

When using Torchmetrics 0.8.0 or newer, the following lines

```python
self.train_acc = Accuracy()
self.valid_acc = Accuracy()
self.test_acc = Accuracy()
```

need to be changed to

```python
self.train_acc = Accuracy(task="multiclass", num_classes=10)
self.valid_acc = Accuracy(task="multiclass", num_classes=10)
self.test_acc = Accuracy(task="multiclass", num_classes=10)
```

## Chapter 15



**Page 530**

The line `from torch.utils.data import Dataset` appears twice.
