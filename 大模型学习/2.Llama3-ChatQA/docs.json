        "BLUETOOTH\u00ae INFORMATION\nBluetooth\u00ae wireless technology is the name for short-range Radio Frequency (RF) technology that allows electronic devices to communicate wirelessly with each other. The Bluetooth\u00ae word mark and logos are owned by the Bluetooth SIG, Inc and any use of such marks by Jaguar Land Rover Limited is under licence. The vehicle's Bluetooth wireless technology system supports Bluetooth wireless technology Hands-Free Profile (HFP), Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP), and Message Access Profile (MAP). HFP, A2DP and AVRCP profiles can be connected independently. A phone can be connected via one profile, while a media device can be connected via the other, at the same time. Before making use of the vehicle's Bluetooth wireless technology phone system, the Bluetooth wireless technology device must be paired and connected to the vehicle's system. The recommended method of connection is via the device to the vehicle. See PAIRING AND CONNECTING USING THE PHONE. Each time the ignition is switched on, the vehicle's system attempts to connect with the last connected phone or media device. Phones and media devices have a wide range of audio and echo characteristics. The vehicle's system may take a few seconds to adapt and deliver optimum audio performance. To achieve this, it may be necessary to reduce the media sound volume and also reduce the ventilation fan speed slightly. Some device's require the Bluetooth wireless technology device pairing feature to be set as authorised or trusted in order to automatically connect. Refer to the device's operating instructions for further information.",
        "FUEL TANK CAPACITY\nAvoid the risk of running out of fuel. Never intentionally drive the vehicle when the fuel gauge indicates that the fuel tank is empty.

        "CHILD SEAT POSITIONING\nMake sure to read and fully understand the relevant warnings before using any of the features in this section. See CHILD SEAT SAFETY. Crash statistics show that children are safest when properly secured in a child restraint system appropriate for the age and weight of the child, in a rear seating position. Failure to use an appropriate restraint system greatly increases the risk of serious injury or death in the event of an accident. Ages given are approximate. If in doubt, the child's weight, not age, should be used when considering an appropriate child seat. The legislation which governs how and where children should be carried when travelling in a vehicle is subject to change. The driver is responsible for making sure that all regulations in force are complied with.",
        "TOPPING UP THE COOLANT\nNever remove the coolant reservoir filler cap when the engine is hot. Escaping steam or scalding water could cause serious personal injury. Unscrew the filler cap slowly, allowing the pressure to escape before removing completely. Antifreeze is highly flammable. Do not allow antifreeze to come into contact with open flames or other sources of ignition, e.g., a hot engine. A fire may result. Antifreeze is poisonous and can be fatal if swallowed. Keep containers sealed and out of the reach of children. If consumption is suspected, seek medical attention immediately. If the fluid comes into contact with the skin or eyes, rinse immediately with plenty of water. When travelling in places where the water supply contains salt, always make sure to carry a supply of fresh (rain or distilled) water. Topping up with salt water will cause serious engine damage. The use of non-approved antifreeze has an adverse effect on the engine's cooling system and, therefore, engine durability. See LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS. Antifreeze damages painted surfaces. Soak up any spillage with an absorbent cloth immediately. Wash the area with a mixture of car shampoo and water. Do not use any anti-leak products in the cooling system, as it causes damage to the vehicle. Antifreeze contains important corrosion inhibitors. The antifreeze content of the coolant must be maintained at 50% to 60% all year round, not just in cold conditions. To make sure the anti-corrosion properties of the coolant are maintained, the antifreeze content should be checked once a year. Regardless of the distance travelled, the antifreeze should be replaced every 10 years. Failure to do so may cause corrosion of the radiator and engine components. The specific gravity of a 50% antifreeze solution at 20\u00b0C is 1.068 and protects against frost down to -40\u00b0C. To top up the coolant:\nRotate the coolant reservoir filler cap counter-clockwise and remove.",
        "Top up to the MAX indicator mark on the side of the coolant reservoir. Use a mixture of 50% water and 50% antifreeze. See LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS. In an emergency, and only if the approved antifreeze is unavailable, top up the cooling system with clean water. Be aware of the resultant reduction in frost protection. Do not top up or refill with conventional antifreeze formulations. If in doubt, consult a qualified technician. To refit the coolant reservoir filler cap, rotate the filler cap clockwise, until the cap's ratchet clicks at least three times.",

        "CHARGING STATUS (WHITE)\nThe charging status lamp illuminates white and flashes to indicate the vehicle is connected to an external charger and the charging process is initiating, or if charging is paused.",
        "OCTANE RATING\nDo not use fuels with an octane rating lower than 91 RON, as severe engine damage may occur. Do not use leaded fuels, fuels with lead substitutes, e.g., manganese-based or fuel additives. Doing so may adversely affect the vehicle's emission control systems and affect the vehicle's warranty. The vehicle manufacturer recommends the use of premium unleaded fuel with a minimum octane rating of 95 RON. Using the correct fuel specification helps to maintain the vehicle's performance, fuel economy, and driveability. If premium unleaded fuel is not available, use unleaded fuel with a lower octane rating, down to a minimum of 91 RON. Using lower octane-rated fuel may reduce the engine's performance, increase fuel consumption, cause an audible engine knock, and cause other driveability problems. Consult a retailer/authorised repairer if an engine knock is detected while holding a steady speed on level roads. Also consult a retailer/authorised repairer if a heavy persistent engine knock is detected, even if using fuel to the recommended octane rating. Failure to do so is misuse of the vehicle, which is not covered by the vehicle's warranty. An occasional, light engine knock when accelerating or climbing hills is acceptable. Super Green Plus 98 RON unleaded fuel, where available, may be used as an alternative to the standard 95 RON unleaded fuel.",
        "BLIND SPOT MONITOR LIMITATIONS\nThe blind spot monitor system does not operate when:\nReverse (R) or Park (P) is selected. The vehicle's speed is below 10 km/h (6 mph).

Does not work accurately if the sensors are misaligned due to bumper modifications or impact damage.",
        "DISABLING THE PASSENGER AIRBAG\nMake sure to read and fully understand the relevant warnings before using any of the features in this section. See AIRBAG SAFETY. The passenger airbag should only be disabled when a child restraint is fitted to the front passenger seat. Incorrect usage of the passenger airbag presents a high risk of death or serious injury in the event of an accident. Crash test data and statistics show that a correctly fitted child seat in a rear seat is the safest place to restrain a child. Do not use a child restraint on a seat protected by an operational airbag in front of it. Doing so presents a high risk of death or serious injury to the child in the event of an accident. Before checking the operational status of the front passenger airbag, switch the vehicle's ignition on. Wait until the warning lamp bulb check period of 8 seconds has elapsed before carrying out any checks. Incorrect usage of the passenger airbag presents a high risk of death or serious injury in the event of an accident. As soon as the child seat is removed from the front passenger seat, the airbag must be switched on. Failure to do so will put any front seat passengers at greater risk of death or serious injury in the event of an accident. Do not fit a child restraint to the front passenger seat if the airbag warning lamp illuminates continuously with the ignition switched on. An inflating airbag could impact with the seat and could cause serious injury. The passenger airbag must be disabled when a rearward-facing child restraint is fitted to the front passenger seat. Failure to do so presents a high risk of death or serious injury to the child in the event of an accident.",
        "Disabling the passenger airbag is market dependent. When the vehicle is stationary, the front passenger's airbag can be switched on and off via the vehicle instrument panel menu. See INSTRUMENT PANEL OVERVIEW. An airbag status indicator lamp, mounted in the overhead console, displays the operational status of the passenger airbag, as shown in the following table:\n|Setting||Passenger airbag status||Airbag status indicator|\n|Off.||Disabled.||PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF|\n|On.||Activated.||ON PASSENGER AIRBAG*|\n* Displays for 60 seconds, then extinguishes.

        "TRAILER DIRECTION INDICATORS (GREEN)\nThe trailer direction indicator lamp illuminates, as a bulb check, when the vehicle's ignition is switched on. The lamp extinguishes when the engine is started. If a trailer is attached, the warning lamp flashes in conjunction with the direction indicator warning lamp. If the lamp fails to flash, the direction indicator bulb on the trailer may be faulty. If a connected trailer is fitted with LED lights, the bulb check may not be performed.",
        "AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING (AEB) SAFETY\nMake sure the following warnings and notes have been read and fully understood before driving the vehicle. Failure to understand the Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system could result in an accident, leading to serious injury or death. The AEB system is a driving aid only. The driver is responsible for driving with due care and attention, and in a safe manner for the vehicle, the occupants, and other road users. The driver should observe all road signs, road markings and any potential emergency braking situations, and act appropriately. The AEB system uses forward-facing cameras and forward-facing radars to detect real vehicles and pedestrians, plus other certified target objects. AEB is not designed to detect any other objects, including non-industry approved targets. In order for AEB to operate, it must be able to detect a clear image of the object and be able to determine its movement. If neither of these occur, the AEB system may not operate. Seat belts should be worn by all vehicle occupants, for every journey, no matter how short. Failure to do so greatly increases the risk of death or serious injury in the event of sudden braking or an accident. Make sure that the windscreen is kept clean and that the camera's line of sight is not obstructed by labels or stickers. Failure to do so can cause incorrect AEB operation. AEB efficiency is dependent on the condition of the current driving surface and the vehicle's speed, tyres, and braking system. When a vehicle is parked outside, in full sunlight and in high ambient temperatures, the forward-facing camera may reach an internal temperature of 99\u00b0C (210\u00b0F). In this state, the instrument panel displays a warning message. When the forward-facing camera cools to less than 88\u00b0C (190\u00b0F), normal operation is resumed, and the warning message extinguishes.",
        "When the vehicle's electrical system is first switched on, AEB may require an initialisation period before it is fully functional. AEB efficiency is limited during this period.",
        "AIRBAG OPERATION\nMake sure to read and fully understand the relevant warnings before using any of the features in this section. See AIRBAG SAFETY. The airbag Supplementary Restraint System (SRS) inflates instantaneously, and cannot provide protection in secondary or some other types of impact. Under these circumstances, the only protection is provided by a correctly worn seat belt. Airbag deployment is dependent on the rate at which the passenger compartment changes velocity following a collision. Circumstances affecting different collisions, vehicle speed, angle of impact, type and size of object hit, etc. vary considerably and affect the rate of vehicle deceleration accordingly. The airbags and SRS are not designed to operate as a result of:\nRear impacts. Minor front impacts. Minor side impacts. Heavy braking. Driving over bumps and pot holes. Therefore, it follows that considerable superficial damage to the vehicle can occur, without causing the airbags to deploy.",
        "BATTERY MONITORING SYSTEM\nOnly start the engine if it is safe to do so. Failure to do so may lead to a collision, potentially resulting in serious injury or death. The Intelligent Power System Management (IPSM) continuously monitors the condition of the main vehicle battery. If excessive battery discharge occurs, the system begins to shut down non-essential electrical systems, in order to protect the battery. If the IPSM calculates that the battery's condition is not within the set parameters, there are two levels of action which can be taken. Both levels have an accompanying message on the touchscreen, and in the case of the low battery warning, in the instrument panel. Energy Management: Is displayed in the instrument panel if the engine is not running and system features are causing excessive battery discharge. After 10 minutes, the IPSM begins shutting down the vehicle's systems. Normal system operation resumes when the engine is started. Low battery - Please start engine: Is displayed on the touchscreen and in the instrument panel, if the engine is not running. After 10 minutes, the IPSM begins shutting down the vehicle's systems. Normal system operation resumes when the engine is started. If the instrument panel displays Low Battery - Please Start Engine, drive the vehicle to allow the battery to recover to an acceptable level. Drive the vehicle for at least 30 minutes in temperatures above 0\u00b0C, or at least 60 minutes if the temperatures are below 0\u00b0C. If normal system operation does not resume when the engine is switched back off, the battery may not have been sufficiently charged. If safe to do so, restart the engine. If problems still exist, contact a retailer/authorised repairer.",
        "DIESEL EXHAUST FLUID (DEF)\nDiesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) must be kept out of children's reach, to avoid serious injury or death. Read the label for safety precautions when using DEF, to avoid injury or death. DEF must be stored in the original container, in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area. Observe the manufacturer's storage and handling recommendations. If inappropriately stored, DEF may spill or be exposed to contamination. DEF has a strong odour and can stain clothing or upholstery. Take care not to spill the fluid when performing a top-up procedure. In the event of spillage, rinse immediately with clean water. When refilling, make sure that the correct specification of DEF is used. Use of the incorrect fluid can result in serious damage to the vehicle. In this situation, do not start the engine. Contact a retailer/authorised repairer immediately. Do not overfill the DEF tank. Vehicles with a diesel engine may have a tank containing DEF. DEF is used to make sure that correct exhaust emissions are achieved. DEF is also known as AdBlue\u2122, AUS 32, and ARLA 32. AdBlue\u2122 is a trademark of the Verband der Automobilindustrie e.V. (VDA). Dependent on the current geographical location, correct use of the DEF system may be a legal requirement. Running the vehicle without the correct specification of DEF may be a criminal offence. Always use the correct DEF specification and the correct quantity of DEF. See LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS and CAPACITIES. The consumption of DEF can vary greatly. An average consumption rate can be 800 km (500 miles) / 1 Litre. However, this consumption rate can be more than doubled, depending on driving style, and road and weather conditions. The distance until the DEF tank is empty and the volume of DEF required for refill can be displayed via the Touchscreen:\nTouch the settings icon\u00b9 from any screen.",

Touch the exit icon\u00b2 to return to the previously displayed screen. The instrument panel displays a series of messages when the DEF level becomes low. The volume of DEF required for a refill also accompanies each message. The first message states that the DEF level is at a level where a top-up is advised. The second message is accompanied by an AMBER warning icon and states to refill the DEF tank. The third message starts a countdown of the distance remaining until the DEF tank is empty. After the countdown, vehicle start is inhibited. The final message is accompanied by a RED warning icon and is displayed when the distance remaining is zero. The final message states that no further restarts are possible until DEF is added to the tank. To perform a full DEF system refill, it is recommended to contact a retailer/authorised repairer. If required, DEF can be added to the tank by following the top-up procedure. The volume of DEF required to top-up or restart the engine is displayed in the instrument panel. To perform a DEF top-up procedure, locate the DEF filler. See FLUID FILLER LOCATIONS. Then, follow the steps below:\nTurn the tank filler cap counter-clockwise to remove. Making sure not to exceed the required volume, top-up the tank following the instructions given on the DEF container. Non-drip bottles are the recommended method for top-up. Replace the tank filler cap and continually turn clockwise until hand tight. If a DEF warning lamp or message illuminates with a red warning icon, seek qualified assistance at the earliest opportunity. The possible events for this include DEF system malfunctions, incorrect fluid, and poor fluid quality.",
        "See DIESEL EXHAUST FLUID (DEF) (RED) and DIESEL EXHAUST FLUID (DEF) (AMBER). In temperatures below -10\u00b0C, DEF may freeze in the tank, making refilling difficult. Move the vehicle into a warmer environment, e.g., a garage. Raise the ambient temperature, in order to thaw the DEF, before attempting to top up. In these conditions, it may take up to 1 hour of driving before the low DEF message extinguishes. When starting and stopping the engine, operation of the DEF pumps may be heard, but this is no cause for concern. The check engine amber warning lamp may illuminate after a refill. In this event, start the engine, run for approximately 30 seconds, and then switch off the engine. Do this three times in succession. See CHECK ENGINE (AMBER).

        "LOCKING WHEEL NUTS\nNot all vehicles have locking wheel nuts as standard parts. The locking wheel nut adaptor must be correctly aligned and fully fitted to the locking wheel nut before usage. Incorrect fitment can result in permanent damage to the locking wheel nut adaptor. If in doubt, contact a retailer/authorised repairer. Do not use air tools or power tools to remove or to refit the locking wheel nuts. Doing so may damage the locking wheel nuts or the locking wheel nut adaptor. The locking wheel nuts are dependent on the vehicle's specification:\nVehicles with alloy wheels. Vehicles with steel wheels. Locking wheel nuts can be removed and fitted using only the special adaptor provided. See TOOL KIT. To release the locking wheel nuts:\nFit the locking wheel nut adaptor onto the locking wheel nut. Make sure that the locking wheel nut adaptor fully engages.

Ignoring low fluid levels or uneven tyre wear may cause damage to the vehicle. In addition to the routine maintenance, a number of simple checks must be carried out more frequently.",
        "USING WINTER TYRES\nA dedicated winter tyre often has a lower speed rating than the original equipment tyre. Consequently, the vehicle must be driven within the speed limitation of the winter tyre. Consult a retailer/authorised repairer for further information. In markets that require a tyre's maximum speed label to be fitted, make sure to place the label within the driver's field of vision. Maximum speed labels can be obtained from the tyre retailer. Failure to adhere to the winter tyre's speed limit may result in an accident, potentially leading to serious injury or death. M+S tyres have a recognised level of winter performance. However, the M+S marking on the sidewall of the tyre does not necessarily indicate that the tyre is a dedicated winter tyre. The M+S marking on an all-season tyre indicates that it is designed for use all year round, including in cold temperatures, snow, and ice. The performance of all-season tyres is generally inferior to a dedicated winter tyre in conditions specific to winter. In many countries, legislation exists that requires the use of winter tyres during specified periods of the year. The winter tyres symbol identifies dedicated winter tyres. Dedicated winter tyres are recommended if optimum winter traction is required, or if the vehicle is to be used in more extreme winter conditions. The tyre pressures indicated on the tyre information label are for use in all conditions on the original equipment tyres. If a reduced speed-rating tyre is fitted, the recommended pressures are only suitable up to the tyre's maximum speed, with a normal vehicle load. Vehicle speed should be restricted to below 160 km/h (100 mph) when heavily loaded. Winter tyres must be fitted to all four wheels. For optimum traction, the tyres should be run-in for at least 160 km on dry roads, before driving on snow or ice.",
        "Use of dedicated winter tyres may require a change of wheel size, depending on the original choice of wheel. All four wheels must be changed. If the wheels fitted have standard rubber valves, the Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) warning lamp flashes for 75 seconds and then remains illuminated. When the original wheels and tyres are refitted, the vehicle needs to travel a short distance to reset the TPMS and extinguish the warning lamp. |Recommended winter tyres|\n|Wheel size||Tyre size||Brand||Pattern||Rim width / Profile / Offset||Type|\n|18 in||255/70R18 116V||Michelin||Pilot Alpin 5||8.0J / CH+ / 41.5||Alpine|\n|Nokian||Hakkapeliitta R3 SUV||Studless|\n|19 in||255/65R19 114V||Continental||TS 850 P SUV||8.0J / CH2 / 41.5||Alpine|\n|20 in||255/60R20 113V||Pirelli||Scorpion Winter||8.5J / CH+ / 41.5||Alpine|\n|275/55R20 117Q||Nokian||Hakkapeliitta R3 SUV||Studless|\n|22 in||275/45R22 112W||Continental||TS 850 P SUV||9.0J / CH+ / 43.0||Alpine|\n|Michelin||Xice N4 SUV||Studded|\nStudded tyres are market dependent.

When the tyres are cold, inflate to the recommended cold tyre pressures, shown on the tyre pressure label, if:\nTPMS is not fitted to the vehicle. The advised tyre pressures are not displayed in the instrument panel. See TYRE PRESSURE LABEL. To avoid damaging the valves, do not apply excessive force or sideways pressure on the gauge and/or inflator. To avoid damage to the TPMS valves, it is recommended not to use rigid tyre inflation wands. Rigid tyre inflation wands increase the risk of excess leverage and sideways pressure on the valve. The following procedure must be used to adjust the tyre pressures:\nRemove the tyre valve cap. Firmly attach a tyre pressure gauge and/or inflator to the valve. Read the tyre pressure from the gauge and add air, if required. If air is added to the tyre via a manual gauge, remove the gauge and re-attach it before reading the pressure. Failure to do so may result in an inaccurate reading. If the tyre pressure is too high, remove the gauge and press the centre of the valve to allow air out of the tyre. Refit the gauge to the valve and check the pressure. Refit the valve cap.",

        "ADAPTIVE DRIVING BEAM (ADB)\nThe Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) system cannot be relied upon to activate or deactivate high beam in all possible circumstances. The driver remains responsible for the correct use of the headlights at all times. Incorrect use of the headlights may cause an accident, potentially resulting in serious injury or death. The forward-facing sensors are mounted on the rear of the rear-view mirror. Keep this area of the vehicle clean and free from obstructions, e.g., stickers, debris, mud, snow, or ice. Failure to do so can lead to accidents, potentially resulting in serious injury or death. ADB activates automatically once the vehicle's speed reaches 40 km/h (25 mph) and the camera does not detect an urban environment. ADB automatically deactivates when the vehicle's speed slows to 24 km/h (15 mph), when ambient light exceeds a predetermined level or when the gear selector is in Reverse (R). ADB is defined as a system that evaluates the road scene ahead of the vehicle. ADB automatically adapts the light distribution according to the position of the preceding and oncoming traffic. ADB is enabled when the lighting control is in the AUTO position and the ambient light level is below a predetermined level. When ADB is active, the blue high beam indicator lamp remains illuminated, as the headlights will deploy partial or full high beam at this time. See HIGH BEAM (BLUE). The driver can disable and re-enable the ADB system at any time via the touchscreen:\nTouch the settings icon\u00b9 from any screen. Touch the ALL soft key. Touch Vehicle. Touch Exterior Lights.

Failure to use adaptive cruise control or any of its features safely could result in an accident, leading to serious injury or death. Adaptive cruise control is not a substitute for driving safely, with due care and attention. Staying alert, driving safely, and being in control of the vehicle at all times is the responsibility of the driver. Adaptive cruise control may not function properly under all weather and road conditions. Do not use adaptive cruise control in poor visibility, specifically fog, heavy rain, spray, or snow. Using adaptive cruise control in these conditions increases the risk of a loss of control of the vehicle. Adaptive cruise control does not react to pedestrians, objects in the roadway or oncoming vehicles in the same lane. Additionally, the system may not react to stationary or slow moving vehicles (e.g. cyclists and motorcyclists). Adaptive cruise control uses a radar sensor and camera to monitor the area in front of the vehicle. The radar sensor is mounted on the front of the vehicle. The camera is mounted on the rear of the rear-view mirror. Keep these areas of the vehicle clean and free from obstructions, e.g., stickers, debris, mud, snow, or ice. Failure to do so may result in the system failing to identify objects ahead. The driver should remain alert and intervene, if necessary, when adaptive cruise control is in operation. The adaptive cruise control system may operate unexpectedly in certain conditions. For example:\nWhen driving on a different line to the vehicle in front. When a vehicle edges into the same lane as the vehicle being driven. The vehicle is only detected once it has moved fully into the same lane.",

        "TYRE PRESSURE SAFETY\nMake sure to read and fully understand the following warnings. Failure to comply with the safety instructions could result in an accident, leading to serious injury or death. Check the tyres, including the spare, for condition and pressure on a weekly basis and before long journeys. All tyre pressures, including the spare, should be checked. Failure to properly maintain the tyre pressures could increase the risk of tyre failure. The loading of the vehicle should always be considered when checking and adjusting the tyre pressures. Failure to do so may lead to a loss of control, potentially causing serious injury or death. See TYRE PRESSURE LABEL. Always use a calibrated tyre pressure gauge. Using an un-calibrated tyre pressure gauge may result in tyres with incorrect pressures. Incorrect tyre pressure can lead to vehicle instability. Never drive the vehicle if the tyre pressures are incorrect. Under-inflation causes excessive flexing and uneven tyre wear, which can lead to sudden tyre failure. Over-inflation causes harsh ride, uneven tyre wear and poor handling. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tyre tread life and may affect the vehicle's handling and stopping ability. If the tyre pressures are checked while the vehicle is inside a protected, covered area, e.g., a garage, and subsequently driven in lower outdoor temperatures, tyre under-inflation could occur. A slight pressure loss occurs naturally with time. If this exceeds 0.14 bar (2 psi, 14 kPa) per week, have the cause investigated and rectified by qualified personnel. Pressure checks should be carried out ideally when the tyres are cold, and the vehicle has been stationary for more than 3 hours. A hot tyre at, or below, the recommended cold inflation pressure, is dangerously under-inflated. Tyres can be hot after driving, if the vehicle has been parked in strong sunlight, or used in high ambient temperatures.",
        "Do not reduce the tyre pressures. Recheck the pressures when cold. If the tyre pressures are checked when the tyres are warm, expect the pressures to have increased by up to 0.3 to 0.4 bar (4 to 6 psi, 30 to 40 kPa). If Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) advised pressures are not available in the instrument panel, allow the tyres to cool fully before adjusting the pressures. For vehicles with TPMS, it is possible to adjust the pressure of a warm tyre, providing the advised pressures are used. See TYRE PRESSURE CHECK.",

        "FITTING ISOFIX AND I-SIZE CHILD RESTRAINTS\nMake sure to read and fully understand the relevant warnings before using any of the features in this section. See CHILD SEAT SAFETY. Do not attempt to fit ISOFIX or i-Size child restraints to the centre second row seating position. The anchor bars are not designed to hold an ISOFIX or i-Size child restraint in this position. The child could be endangered in a crash if the child restraint is not properly secured in the vehicle. If removing a head restraint in order to fit a child restraint, always secure the head restraint when storing it. Always refit a removed head restraint after the child restraint is removed. The child could be endangered in a crash if the child restraint is not properly secured in the vehicle. WARNING: child restraint anchorages are designed to withstand only those loads imposed by correctly fitted child restraints. Under no circumstances are they to be used for adult seat belts, harnesses, or for attaching other items or equipment to the vehicle. If the child restraint is not correctly anchored, there is a significant risk of injury to the child in the event of a collision or emergency braking. The front seat ISOFIX and i-Size fitment is not standard and is market/derivative specific. ISOFIX and i-Size child restraints can be fitted in the following locations:\nThe front passenger seat (not available in all markets). The outer seating positions on the second row seats. To install an ISOFIX or i-Size child restraint:\nA label displaying the ISOFIX and i-Size symbol is sewn into the flaps covering the lower anchor bars, or on the seats close to the lower anchor bars. The label indicates the position of the ISOFIX or i-Size anchorages. Slide the child seat into position and attach the locking mechanism to the ISOFIX or i-Size anchor bars.",
        "Some child restraints are fitted with an upper tether anchorage. See FITTING TETHER ANCHORAGE CHILD RESTRAINTS. Test the security of the child restraint. To do this, attempt to pull the restraint away from the vehicle's seat and twist the restraint from side to side. Even if the restraint appears secure, the anchor points should be checked visually, to make sure they are correctly attached. Always make sure that if an upper tether is provided, it is fitted and tightened correctly. For child restraints fitted with a support leg, adjust the leg so that it rests firmly on the floor. After removing a child restraint, always make sure the lower anchor bar flap is fully closed. Failure to fully close a flap could hinder a seat fold manoeuvre.",

        "PARTS AND ACCESSORIES WARRANTY\nThere is a separate parts warranty for genuine Jaguar Land Rover parts and accessories purchased. Should any genuine part or accessory require repair or replacement as a result of a material or manufacturing defect, the part or accessory will be repaired or replaced completely free of charge by any authorised retailer/repairer. Genuine parts and accessories have been specifically designed to comply with Jaguar Land Rover safety and reliability standards. We, therefore, recommend that only genuine parts and accessories are used on the vehicle. Please be advised that non-genuine parts and accessories have neither been tested or approved by Jaguar Land Rover, and that, in spite of constant observation of the market, Jaguar Land Rover cannot evaluate their suitability and safety, neither isolated or when fitted to our vehicles. The warranty commences on the date of delivery of the part or vehicle accessory and is applicable for a period of 12 months or as per agreed local market legislation or the stated service life of the part or vehicle accessory, whichever occurs later. All parts or vehicle accessories fitted during warranty repairs are covered for the balance of the original warranty period. Market legislation may overrule this. Genuine Jaguar Land Rover 12 volt batteries and exhaust components are covered by a 3 year warranty. All other batteries are covered by the standard part warranty period as detailed above.",
        "SWITCHING DYNAMIC STABILITY CONTROL (DSC) OFF\nMake sure the relevant safety warnings have been read and understood before driving the vehicle. See DYNAMIC STABILITY CONTROL (DSC) SAFETY. The vehicle's stability and safety may be reduced by inappropriately switching Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) off. Switching DSC off could result in a loss of control of the vehicle, potentially leading to serious injury or death. Press and briefly hold the DSC OFF button on the front control panel to switch DSC off. A tone sounds and the DSC OFF warning lamp illuminates. See DYNAMIC STABILITY CONTROL (DSC) OFF (AMBER). Switching DSC off reduces the level of traction and stability control intervention. An increase in wheel spin and a reduction in the vehicle's stability may be experienced. In the majority of driving situations, and particularly on-road, it is recommended that DSC is not switched off. DSC cannot be switched off if the comfort, ECO or AUTO terrain response driving programs are selected. See TERRAIN RESPONSE OVERVIEW. Make sure DSC is switched back on at the earliest opportunity. See SWITCHING DYNAMIC STABILITY CONTROL (DSC) ON.",
        "EVENT DATA RECORDING\nThe vehicle is equipped with an Event Data Recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is to record data in certain circumstances that will assist in understanding how a vehicle's systems performed. Such circumstances are crash or near crash-like situations e.g. an airbag deployment or hitting a road obstacle. The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as:\nHow various systems in the vehicle were operating. Whether or not the driver and passenger seat belts were buckled or fastened. How far, if at all, the driver was pressing the accelerator and/or the brake pedal. How fast the vehicle was travelling. The collected data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur. EDR data are recorded by the vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation occurs. No data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions. No personal data, e.g., name, gender, age, and crash location, are recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation. To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR. Please be advised that this vehicle incorporates an Event Data Recorder (EDR). An EDR stores driving information at the moment of accident (driving speed, application of brake pedal and accelerator control etc. ), and enables to confirm the information stored.",

Once enabled, activate stealth mode by switching the touchscreen off, using the power button on the touchscreen. If night time conditions exist when the touchscreen is switched off, interior switch illumination and instrument panel back-lighting automatically reduce to the minimum light levels. Stealth mode deactivates if night time conditions no longer exist, or if the touchscreen is switched back on.",
        "AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING (AEB)\nMake sure the relevant safety warnings and notes have been read and understood before driving the vehicle. See AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING (AEB) SAFETY. Not all vehicles are fitted with Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB). Consult a retailer/authorised repairer for confirmation. The driver is recommended to switch off the AEB system when driving off-road, when using a car wash, or when the vehicle is being towed. AEB uses forward-facing cameras, located above the rear-view mirror, and forward-facing radars, located on the front bumper, to help identify an imminent risk of collision with:\nAnother vehicle travelling in front. An oncoming vehicle from adjacent lane while host vehicle turning left or right. A crossing pedestrian. A pedestrian moving in the same direction as the vehicle. An oncoming pedestrian from opposite direction while host vehicle turning left or right. A crossing cyclist. A cyclist travelling in the same direction as the vehicle. An oncoming cyclist from opposite direction while host vehicle turning left or right. In most instances, AEB helps reduce the severity of an impact. In some cases, AEB helps to stop the vehicle before an impact takes place. AEB automatically switches on, every time the vehicle's electrical system is switched on. If required, the AEB feature can be switched off via the touchscreen. To switch AEB off, complete the following steps:\nTouch the settings icon from any screen. See SYSTEM SETTINGS. Select Vehicle. Select Driver Assistance. Select Collision avoidance. Emergency braking: Touch to switch the toggle on or off. AEB operates at speeds above 5 km/h (3 mph). The vehicle detection AEB system can detect:\nVehicles travelling in the same road lane of speeds up to 130 km/h (80 mph). Vehicles travelling in the adjacent road lane of speeds up to 64 km/h (39 mph). The system only detects other vehicles when host vehicle is turning left or right, with a speed of up to 20 km/h (12 mph).",
        "The pedestrian and cyclist detection AEB systems are able to operate at speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph). If an imminent risk of a collision is detected, the system automatically applies the brakes. The instrument panel also displays a warning message while AEB is operating. If AEB brings the vehicle to a stop, the brakes continue to hold the vehicle stationary for a few seconds. After this period, the driver must resume full control of the vehicle. Failure to take back full control of the vehicle could result in an accident, leading to serious injury or death. The brake lights are automatically operated in heavy braking situations. The distance required to slow or stop the vehicle is dependent on the condition of the vehicle's tyres and the road surface. The driver can override AEB operation by turning the steering wheel, or pressing the accelerator pedal. When overridden, AEB cancels its request for braking to make sure that the driver remains in full control of the vehicle. After AEB has been activated, a warning sounds and the instrument panel displays a warning message.",

        "WIPER OPERATION\nDo not operate the wipers on a dry screen as the wipers may cause damage to the windscreen. Failure to do so can damage the wiper arms, blades and the windscreen. Remove any snow, ice, or frost from the screen, around the wiper arms and blades, and the cowl area, before operating the wipers. Failure to do so can damage the wiper arms, blades and the windscreen. Make sure the wipers do not stick to the glass during freezing or hot conditions. Use the winter park position during extreme temperatures. Attempting to use the wipers while they are stuck to the glass could cause damage to the wiper blades and mechanism. See WINTER PARK POSITION. To avoid damage to the wiper blade, do not lift the wiper by the wiper blade. Always lift the wiper by the wiper arm. Make sure the wipers are not in automatic rain sensing mode and are switched off before entering a car wash. If the wipers operate during the car washing process, damage may occur to the wiper mechanism. If the wipers leave smears on the glass after the vehicle has been washed, this may be due to wax or other residue. Should this occur, clean the glass with the recommended screen washer fluid. See LUBRICANTS AND FLUIDS. The windscreen is no longer wiped effectively and the automatic rain sensing mode degrades if the wipers become worn. Always replace worn or damaged wiper blades as soon as possible. The wipers service position moves the wipers to allow wiper blade replacement. See WIPERS SERVICE POSITION. If the wipers become stuck or jammed, an electronic cut-out temporarily halts operation of the wipers. If this happens, switch off the wipers and the vehicle's ignition, when safe to do so. Clear any obstructions and free the wiper blades before attempting to switch on the vehicle's ignition.",

        "THE EXTERIOR\nFollowing cleaning of the vehicle's exterior, particularly with a pressure washer, it is recommended that the vehicle is taken for a short drive to dry out the brakes. Wet brakes may impair the vehicle's ability to safely slow down which may result in accidents causing serious injury or death. Make sure the tail pipe is cool before polishing the tail pipe finishers. Failure to do so may result in personal injury. To prevent damage to the vehicle when using a valeting service, make sure to advise of the cleaning instructions contained within the Owner's Handbook. Remove any heavy deposits of mud and dirt with a hose, before washing the vehicle. Failure to do so may cause damage to the vehicle. Some high pressure cleaning systems are sufficiently powerful enough to penetrate suspension joints and door or window seals, and damage trim and door locks. Never aim the water jet directly at any camera, the engine air intake, heater air intakes, body seals, doors, the sliding canvas roof, the panoramic roof, windows, etc. Do not aim the water jet at any components which may be damaged such as lights, mirrors, exterior trim, suspension seals and gaiters, etc. Make sure that the pressure washer nozzle is always at a distance of more than 300 mm from any vehicle component. Failure to do so may cause damage to the vehicle. Do not use an automated car wash. Using unapproved cleaning equipment can cause damage to the vehicle's the sliding canvas roof. Do not use a power wash system in the engine bay area, as it may damage the vehicle's electrical components. Substances which are corrosive, such as bird droppings, can damage the vehicle's paintwork. Remove any such substances immediately. Use only cleaning products approved for use on vehicles. Using unapproved cleaning products may damage the vehicle.",
        "Do not apply polish to any unpainted areas of bumper mouldings. Such areas can become ingrained in the textured finish. After washing the vehicle, it is recommended to use a suitable metal polish on stainless steel or chrome finishers to restore the surface appearance. Make sure that the canvas roof channels or panoramic roof channels are kept clean to allow continued smooth operation of the mechanism. Do not aim the water jet directly at any rubber gaiters or seals on the suspension joints. Make sure that the water jet nozzle is more than 300 mm away from vehicle components. Do not leave the canvas roof in the open position for longer than is necessary, as in certain circumstances, permanent soiling along the folds may occur. Cleaning: Every 1 600 km, vacuum clean and wash the canvas roof. A retailer/authorised repairer is able to recommend suitable products. Reproofing: Every 8 000 km, reproof the canvas roof material. A retailer/authorised repairer is able to recommend suitable products.",

        "FITTING THE DETACHABLE TOW BALL\nMake sure the relevant safety warnings and cautions have been read and understood before towing a trailer. See TOWING SAFETY. The detachable tow ball is very heavy. Extreme care must be taken when manoeuvring the tow ball. Use two hands to safely manoeuvre the tow ball. Make sure that no body part is below the tow ball during fitment or removal. Failure to safely manoeuvre the tow ball could result in serious injury or death. The detachable tow ball is stored under the loadspace floor. To fit the detachable tow ball:\nRemove the protective cover from the mounting bracket. Store in a safe place. Take note of the orientation of the cover to aid refitting. Insert the key and turn clockwise to unlock the handwheel. Pull the handwheel away from the tow ball. Simultaneously turn the handwheel approximately half a turn counter-clockwise. The red lug on the handwheel should enter the green indicator scale. Rotate the handwheel counter-clockwise until it locks into position. The red lug should remain in the green indicator scale. Using both hands, push the tow ball up into the mounting bracket. A click is heard when the tow ball is fitted correctly. The handwheel returns to sit flush against the tow ball. The green indicator lug should be aligned with the green indicator scale. Insert the key and turn counter-clockwise to lock the handwheel. Once the tow ball is fitted, replace the keyhole cover and safely store the key below the loadspace floor. The detachable tow ball should be removed if it is not required for immediate use. See REMOVING THE DETACHABLE TOW BALL. Make sure the detachable tow ball is stored safely in its bag using the lashing eyes on the loadspace floor. In the event of an accident, or under heavy braking, the tow ball can become a projectile, potentially causing serious injury or death.",

        "USING SNOW CHAINS\nMake sure the following warnings have been read and fully understood before using snow chains. Failure to use the snow chains safely could result in an accident, leading to serious injury or death. Only use traction devices in heavy snow conditions, on compacted snow. Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) must be switched off when using traction devices. Never exceed 50 km/h (30 mph) when traction devices are fitted. Never fit traction devices to a temporary-use spare wheel. Traction devices approved by the vehicle manufacturer may be used to improve traction in heavy snow conditions, on compacted snow. Traction devices should not be used in off-road conditions where there is no compacted snow. If it becomes necessary to fit traction devices, the following points must be observed:\nOnly use vehicle manufacturer approved traction devices on the vehicle. Only vehicle manufacturer approved traction devices have been tested to make sure that the devices do not cause damage to the vehicle. Contact a retailer/authorised repairer for information. The wheels and tyres fitted to the vehicle must conform to the specifications of the vehicle manufacturer's original equipment. Doing so helps to enhance the performance of the traction devices. See TYRE MARKINGS. Full-chain traction devices can be fitted to the rear wheels of vehicles with the following tyre sizes:\n255/70R18. 255/65R19. 255/60R20. Do not fit a traction device to a temporary-use spare wheel. Always read, understand, and follow the traction device manufacturer's instructions. Pay particular attention to the maximum speed and fitting instructions. Fit traction devices in pairs on the same axle. Remove the traction devices, as soon as the conditions allow, to avoid tyre and/or vehicle damage. Contact a retailer/authorised repairer for details and availability of approved snow chains. When using snow chains, select the grass gravel snow driving program and switch DSC off.",

        "ONLINE SERVICE HISTORY (OSH)\nThe Online Service History (OSH) system has been introduced to completely replace the stamping of 'Service Record' pages in owner literature. A vehicle's service history is now stored on a centralised system, which can be accessed and amended by a retailer/authorised repairer via the internet. The OSH records every scheduled service event, and includes all those items that need to be inspected, or replaced, over extended periods. Keeping to the recommended service intervals is important to help protect the on-going validity of the manufacturer's warranty. An up-to-date OSH provides the necessary proof of service should any warranty work be required. After each scheduled and extended service visit, the retailer/authorised repairer updates the OSH for the vehicle. A printed copy of the complete record is also provided as proof that the required service has been performed. As the OSH is securely stored for the life of the vehicle, it can be viewed online, at anytime. The OSH helps to enhance the vehicle's resale value and each subsequent owner will be able to obtain a service history they can trust. Any retailer/authorised repairer can produce an up-to-date OSH printout for the vehicle. The printout also contains details of how to register and view the vehicle's OSH. For any questions regarding the OSH system, please contact a retailer/authorised repairer or the Land Rover distributor for the market. The distributor may also be contacted through the Land Rover internet site. OSH is not available in all markets. For these markets, a Service Record publication is provided. See SERVICE RECORD.",

        "CHECKING THE ENGINE OIL LEVEL\nCheck the engine oil frequently. If any significant or sudden drop in the oil level is noted, seek qualified assistance. Never allow the engine oil level to fall below the lower mark on the dipstick or the oil level indicator. Top up, as required, using the correct oil specification for the engine. If the instrument panel displays the message ENGINE OIL PRESSURE LOW, stop the vehicle as soon as it is safe to do so. Allowing the engine to continue running with low oil pressure may cause the engine to seize. Seek qualified assistance immediately. Do not start the engine until the cause has been rectified. The graphic shown above is for illustrative purposes only. The dipstick features minimum and maximum marks in order to help determine the oil level present in the engine. The marks can take the form of holes, lines or a hatched area. The dipstick on the 2.0L petrol engine features a lug to aid correct fitment. Make sure the lug is correctly aligned with the groove in the dipstick tube. Failure to do this could result in the dipstick not fitting correctly and oil escaping from the engine. Before checking the engine oil level, make sure that:\nThe vehicle is stationary and the Electric Parking Brake (EPB) is applied. The vehicle is on level ground. The engine oil is cold. If it is necessary to check the oil level when the engine is hot, switch off the engine and let the vehicle stand for 5 minutes to allow the oil to drain back into the sump. Do not start the engine. The oil level can then be checked as follows:\nWithdraw the dipstick and wipe the blade clean with a lint-free cloth. Fully re-insert the dipstick and withdraw again to check the oil level.",
        "If the oil level lies within the hatched portion on the dipstick blade, do not add any more oil. There is no requirement to top-up the oil unless the oil is at or below the lower mark. If the oil level is below the lower mark, add 1 L of oil. Recheck the level and add more oil, if necessary. Once the oil has reached the correct level on the dipstick, wait 5 minutes and recheck.",

Failure to follow the guidance given could affect vehicle safety, leading to serious injury or death. If the red brake warning lamp illuminates, safely bring the vehicle to a stop as quickly as possible. Seek qualified assistance. If the amber brake warning lamp illuminates, drive with care, avoiding heavy brake pedal application. Seek qualified assistance. Do not rest a foot on the brake pedal while the vehicle is in motion. Doing so can damage the braking system and reduce braking efficiency. Never allow the vehicle to coast (freewheel) with the engine switched off. The engine must be running to provide full braking assistance. The brakes still function with the engine switched off, but far more brake pedal pressure is required to operate them. Never place non-approved floor matting or any other obstructions under the brake pedal. The result can be restricted pedal travel and reduced braking efficiency. Driving through heavy rain or water can have an adverse effect on braking efficiency. Under such circumstances, it is recommended to lightly apply the brakes intermittently, to dry the brakes. Do not pump the brake pedal at any time. Doing so interrupts the operation of the braking system and may increase stopping distances. Repeated or prolonged heavy braking can cause the brakes and the brake fluid to overheat, resulting in reduced braking efficiency and brake failure. Do not drive if the instrument panel displays the Brakes Overheating message. Stop the vehicle as soon as safety permits. Allow the brakes to cool. If necessary, seek qualified assistance before continuing. Driving with overheated brakes can cause increased braking distance or brake failure.

        "EXHAUST FILTER\nExhaust filters are also known as particulate filters. Vehicles fitted with these filters have more efficient emissions control. The particles in the exhaust gases are collected in the exhaust filter during normal driving. Cleaning of the exhaust filter is also known as regeneration. Regeneration occurs automatically depending on driving conditions. Self-cleaning only occurs when the engine has reached its normal operating temperature. Self-cleaning takes place while driving, although the characteristics are different for diesel and petrol engine vehicles. Self-cleaning takes place when the vehicle is driven steadily at speeds between 60 km/h and 112 km/h (37 mph and 70 mph). The process normally takes 10 to 20 minutes. Self-cleaning can occur at lower vehicle speeds, but the process may take a little longer at a 50 km/h (30 mph) average speed. Some driving conditions may not provide sufficient opportunity to begin the exhaust filter self-cleaning automatically. For example: frequently driving short distances in slow-moving traffic, or cold weather. If automatic self-cleaning is not possible, the instrument panel displays the following warning lamps:\nAmber: Exhaust filter self-cleaning is required. Driving above 60 km/h (37 mph) for 20 minutes should clean the filter. Failure to follow the above driving approach, to enable filter self-cleaning, may result in reduced vehicle performance. The amber exhaust filter lamp is eventually replaced by a red exhaust filter lamp. The filter may need to be replaced. Green: Exhaust filter self-cleaning is complete. Red: The exhaust filter is full. Contact a retailer/authorised repairer as soon as possible. A small increase in fuel consumption may be noticed temporarily during exhaust filter self-cleaning. If diesel fuel with high sulphur content is used regularly, the exhaust may emit a cloud of smoke at the start of the self-cleaning process. The smoke is a result of the sulphur deposit being burnt off and is no cause for concern.",
        "If possible, only use low sulphur diesel fuel. Self-cleaning takes place when the engine is at its normal operating temperature and sufficient oxygen is present in the exhaust stream. In most situations, the exhaust filter automatically self-cleans without any driver intervention necessary. Some driving conditions, e.g., repetitive cold starts or continuous full-load driving, may not provide sufficient opportunity to begin the exhaust filter self-cleaning automatically. When this occurs, the instrument panel displays the following warning lamps:\nAmber: Exhaust filter self-cleaning is required. Driving steadily below 80 km/h (50 mph) for up to 15 minutes should clean the filter. Failure to follow the above driving approach, to enable filter self-cleaning, may result in reduced vehicle performance. The amber exhaust filter lamp is eventually replaced by a red exhaust filter lamp. The filter may need to be replaced. Green: Exhaust filter self-cleaning is complete. Red: The exhaust filter is full. Engine power is reduced. Exhaust filter self-cleaning is required. If a restricted performance message is displayed, contact a retailer/authorised repairer as soon as possible. An increase in the idle speed may be noticed temporarily during exhaust filter self-cleaning.",

What are the different types of heart rhythm disorders?Atrial fibrillation (A-fib)Atrial flutterSinus bradycardiaTachycardiaSinus tachycardiaVentricular fibrillation (V-fib)Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach)Premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndromeBradycardiaHeart blocks When the heart's electrical system malfunctions, the normal rhythm of the heart can be affected. Depending upon the abnormality, the heart may begin to beat too fast, too slow, irregularly, or not at all. Heart rhythm disorders are often referred to as cardiac arrhythmias (cardiac = heart; a = lack of) but this is technically incorrect since in most cases there is a heart rhythm, but it is abnormal. Cardiac dysrhythmia (dys = abnormal or faulty + rhythm) might be a better term. Dysrhythmias may occur because of problems directly associated with the electrical \"wiring,\" the SA node, the AV node, or the ventricular conducting system. The issue may also be due to influences on the conducting system from outside the heart. These can include electrolyte abnormalities in the bloodstream, abnormal hormone levels (for example thyroid function that is too high or too low), and medication or drug ingestions. Any abnormality of the electrical cycle within the heart that generates an abnormal beat, whether it is too fast, too slow, skipped, or irregular is considered dysrhythmia. Dysrhythmias are usually classified as originating from above the AV node (supraventricular) or below, the ventricle. They are either fast, slow, irregular and persistent, or intermittent. The heart is a two-stage electric pump whose job it is to circulate blood through the body. The initial electrical impulse that begins the process of a heartbeat is generated by a group of cells located in the upper chamber of the heart, the atrium. These cells act as an automatic pacemaker, starting the electric signal that spreads along the \"wiring\" within the heart muscle, allowing a coordinated squeeze so that the pump can function.",
        "The heart has four chambers. The upper chambers are the right and left atria (singular = atrium) while the lower chambers are the right and left ventricles. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs while the left side pumps it to the rest of the body. Blood from the body depleted of oxygen and containing carbon dioxide is collected in the right atrium and then pushed into the right ventricle with a small beat of the upper chamber of the heart. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen and release carbon dioxide. The oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium where the small atrial beat pushes it to the left ventricle. The left ventricle is much thicker than the right because it needs to be strong enough to send blood to the entire body. There are special cells in the right atrium called the sinoatrial node (SA node) that generate the first electrical impulse, allowing the heart to beat in a coordinated way. The SA node is considered the \"natural pacemaker\" of the heart. This pacemaker function begins the electrical impulse, which follows pathways in the atrial walls, almost like wiring, to a junction box between the atrium and ventricle called the atrioventricular node (AV node). This electric signal causes muscle cells in both atria to contract at once. At the AV node, the electric signal waits for a very short time, usually one- to two-tenths of a second, to allow blood pumped from the atria to fill up the ventricles. The signal then passes through electric bundles in the ventricle walls to allow these chambers to contract, again in a coordinated way, and pump blood to the lungs and body. The SA node generates an electric beat about 60 to 80 times a minute, and each should result in a heartbeat. That beat can be felt as an external pulse. After a heartbeat, the muscle cells of the heart need a split second to get ready to beat again, and the electrical system allows a pause for this to happen.",
        "The heart and its electrical activity work within a narrow range of normal. Fortunately, the body tends to protect the heart as best as it can. Rhythm disturbances may be normal physiologic responses, but some may be potentially life-threatening. Every cell in the heart can act as a pacemaker. A healthy SA node has an intrinsic heartbeat generation rate of 60 to 80. If the atrium fails to generate a heartbeat, then a healthy AV node can do so at a rate of about 40, and if needed, the ventricles themselves can generate heartbeats at a rate of about 20 per minute. This may occur if the cells of the upper chamber fail to generate an electrical impulse or if the electrical signals to the ventricle are blocked. However, these lower rates may be associated with the inability of the heart to pump blood to the body to meet its needs and may result in shortness of breath, chest pain, weakness, or passing out. In the U.S., 1 in every 4 deaths is caused by heart disease. Heart rhythm disturbances may occur because of problems within the heart itself or be the result of abnormalities in the body's environment that can affect the heart's ability to conduct electricity. Cardiac or heart muscle cells become irritated when they are depleted of oxygen. This can occur during a heart attack, in which the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, are blocked. Lack of oxygen can occur when the lungs are unable to extract oxygen from the air. Significant anemia, or low red blood cell count, decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and may prevent adequate oxygen delivery. Rapid heart rates may be due to \"wiring\" problems with the electrical pathways in the heart. This can cause \"short circuits\" making the heart speed up and beat 150 beats a minute or more. The abnormality can be due to a physical extra electrical pathway such as that seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, or it can be due to changes in the electrical physiology between a few cells, like in atrial flutter.",
        "Rapid heart rates can also occur because of environmental issues that affect the heart. These can be intrinsic to the body, like anemia, abnormal electrolyte levels, or abnormal thyroid hormone levels. They may also be due to reactions to outside influences like caffeine, alcohol, over-the-counter cold remedies, or stimulants such as amphetamines. To the cardiac muscle cell, they all appear to be adrenaline-like substances that can cause cell irritation. Slow dysrhythmias can also be problematic. If the heart beats too slowly, the body may not be able to maintain adequate blood pressure and supply the body's organs with enough oxygen-rich blood to function. Slow heart rates may be due to the aging of the SA node and its inability to generate an electrical pacemaker signal. Often though, it is due to the side effects of medications used to control high blood pressure. Side effects of beta-blockers and certain calcium channel blocker drugs include a slowing of the heart rate. The body environment is also important with slow heart rhythm abnormalities. Hypothermia, or low body temperature, is a potential cause.  1 in 6 Kids Haven't Gotten All of Their Vaccines. Why? Kids Who Plant Themselves in Front of TV More Likely to Have Metabolic Syndrome as Adults EPA Awards $58 Million to Help Schools, Daycare Centers Remove Lead From Drinking Water Dementia Patients Wind up in the ER 1.4 Million Times a Year, Study Shows Many people may have heart rhythm disturbances and never be aware of them. Premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are variations of normal and most often, people are unaware that an extra beat has occurred. However, some patients are keenly aware of any extra heartbeat, even if it is a normal variant and requires no treatment. That said, the initial symptom of dysrhythmia is often palpitations, a sensation that the heart is beating too quickly, too slowly, beating irregularly, or skipping a beat. The palpitations may be intermittent or may require medical intervention to resolve.",
        "Because of the heart rhythm abnormality, other symptoms may occur because of decreased cardiac output (the amount of blood that the heart pushes out to meet the body's demand for oxygen and energy). The patient may complain of lightheadedness, weakness, nausea and vomiting, chest pain, and shortness of breath. In critical situations, the patient may fall to the ground or lose consciousness. This may be due to life-threatening dysrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. It may be due to heart rates so fast that there isn't enough blood pressure generated to supply the brain with what it needs. The same result can also occur if the heart beats too slowly and insufficient blood pressure is generated.What are the different types of heart rhythm disorders? Heart rhythm disorders are classified according to where they occur in the heart and how they affect the heartbeat. There are twelve types of heart rhythm disorders include We'll take a look at each type in the next sections. ECG of the Abnormal Conduction of the Heart's Electrical System in AFib Atrial fibrillation occurs when the atrium has lost the ability to beat in a coordinated fashion. Instead of the SA node generating a single electrical signal, numerous areas of the atrium become irritated and produce electrical impulses. This causes the atrium to jiggle, or fibrillate, instead of beating. The AV node sees all the electrical signals, but because there are so many, and because they are so erratic, only some of the hundreds of signals per minute are passed through to the ventricle. The ventricles then fire irregularly and often very quickly. As in PSVT, the symptoms may include palpitations, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. The cause of atrial fibrillation, however, may be more significant, since it may be due to aging of the conducting system of the heart and there may be associated atherosclerotic heart disease. Therefore, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response associated with chest pain or shortness of breath may need emergent cardioversion (a procedure that uses electricity to shock the heart back into a normal rhythm) or intravenous medications to control the heart rate.",
        "One significant complication of atrial fibrillation is the formation of blood clots along the inside of the heart wall. These clots may break off and travel to different organs in the body (embolize), blocking blood vessels and causing the affected organs to malfunction because of the loss of blood supply. A common complication is a clot traveling to the brain, resulting in a stroke. The treatment of atrial fibrillation depends upon many factors including how long it has been present, what symptoms it causes, and the underlying health of the individual. The patient and his or her doctor will decide whether or not to restore a normal sinus rhythm or simply keep the heart rate under control. Atrial fibrillation can be a safe rhythm and not life-threatening when the rate is controlled. Medications are used to slow the electrical impulses through the AV node so that the ventricles do not try to capture each signal being produced. The reason to return people to a regular rhythm has to do with cardiac output. In atrial fibrillation, the atria do not beat and pump blood to the ventricles. Instead, blood flows into the ventricles by gravity alone. This lack of atrial kick can decrease the heart's efficiency and cardiac output by 10% to 15%. Blood thinning, or anticoagulation may be recommended for those patients with atrial fibrillation and an elevated risk for stroke. Oral drugs that anticoagulate are warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis). There are other injectable drugs that are used in a hospital setting. If the patient is at low risk, the doctor may recommend aspirin alone for stroke prevention. If atrial fibrillation is poorly tolerated due to symptomatic palpitations or symptoms of reduced cardiac output, or if there are concerns with lifelong anticoagulation therapy, more definitive therapy may include specific medications, electrical cardioversion, or catheter-based ablation (sometimes with a pacemaker inserted). Atrial fibrillation is a common condition, with many implications, and the best plan for each patient should be discussed at length with one's physician. Atrial flutter",
        "Atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation except that instead of having chaotic electrical firing from all points in the atrium, one point has become irritated and can fire 300 times per minute or more. Many issues that exist for atrial fibrillation apply to atrial flutter. Atrial flutter may degenerate into atrial fibrillation, and the two can often coexist.

The heart, its cells, and its electricity may come under many outside influences causing it to beat more slowly. Sinus bradycardia (brady = slow + cardia = heart) by definition, is a heartbeat generated by the SA node at a rate slower than 60 beats per minute. This may be normal in people who are active and athletic or in patients taking medications designed to slow the heart such as beta blockers and some calcium channel blockers. Vasovagal syncope is an episode of profound sinus bradycardia associated with a noxious stimulus that causes the vagal system of the body to kick in and slow the heart rate. While the sympathetic system of the body is mediated by adrenaline, the parasympathetic system is mediated by the vagus nerve and the chemical acetylcholine, which promotes the exact opposite body reaction to adrenaline. In some people, exposure to pain or a difficult emotional situation can stimulate the vagus nerve, slow the heart, and dilate blood vessels (veins), causing the cardiac output to decrease and making a person feel lightheaded or faint. The vagus nerve also can be stimulated to slow the heart when one bears down to urinate (micturition syncope) or have a bowel movement.Tachycardia Rapid heart rates can originate from either the atrium or the ventricle, but rhythms from the ventricle are more often life threatening. The initial approach to rapid heart rates is to quickly identify the rhythm, and if blood pressure is maintained and there is no evidence of a failing heart, then treatment is directed to rate control with the eventual return of the heart back to normal sinus rhythm. If, however, there is evidence that the heart is failing because of the rapid rate, then emergency measures, including using electricity to shock the heart back into a regular rhythm, may be necessary.Sinus tachycardia",
        "The heart, its cells, and its electricity may come under many outside influences that may cause it to beat more quickly. Sinus tachycardia (sinus = from the SA node + tachy = rapid + cardia = heart), or a rapid regular heartbeat, is a common rhythm issue. It occurs when the body signals the heart to pump more blood, or when the electrical system is stimulated by chemicals.The body needs increased cardiac output in times of physiologic stress. Cardiac output is the amount of blood the heart pumps in the course of 1 minute. It can be calculated by the amount of blood that the heart pumps with each beat (stroke volume) multiplied by the heart rate.Cardiac output = (stroke volume) x (heart rate)The stroke volume tends to be relatively constant. When the body requires extra oxygen delivery, the heart rate needs to increase to meet that demand. Examples include:exercise, in which the muscles have greater oxygen requirements and the heart rate speeds up to pump more blood to meet that need;dehydration, in which there is less fluid in the body and the heart rate has to speed up to compensate; orin cases of acute bleeding that may occur after trauma.The electrical system can be stimulated in a variety of ways to make the heart beat faster. In times of stress, the body generates cortisol and adrenaline, causing an increased heart rate in addition to other changes in the body. Think of being frightened and feeling your heart race. Increased thyroid hormone levels in the body can also cause a tachycardia. Ingestion of a variety of drugs can also cause the heart to race, including caffeine, alcohol, and over-the-counter cold medications that include chemicals such as phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine. These compounds are metabolized by the body and act like an adrenaline stimulus to the heart. Illegal drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine can also cause a sinus tachycardia. ",
        "Signs Psoriasis May Be Affecting Your HeartDiagnosing Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Exercising With HCM: How to Sweat Safely Picture of the Electrical Activity of the Heart during Ventricular Fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) is technically not a rapid heart rhythm because the heart ceases to beat. In ventricular fibrillation, the ventricles do not have a coordinated electrical pattern and the ventricles, instead of beating, just jiggle or fibrillate. Since the heart doesn't beat, blood is not circulated to the body or brain and all bodily functions stop. Without a coordinated impulse to signal the ventricle to beat, sudden cardiac death occurs. The treatment for V-fib is defibrillation with an electrical shock. Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in public places have helped decrease the mortality from sudden cardiac death, but prevention remains the mainstay to survive this event. Some people, such as those with the very weak heart muscle or who have a prior history of ventricular fibrillation will require an implantable defibrillator to prevent future episodes of sudden death and treat this rhythm. This rhythm is often associated with a heart attack in which the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood supply (myocardial ischemia), becomes irritated, and causes secondary irritation of the electrical system. Aside from myocardial ischemia, other causes of ventricular fibrillation may include severe weakness of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), electrolyte disturbances, drug overdose, and poisoning.Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) Ventricular tachycardia is another rapid heart rate that originates in the ventricle. The causes are the same as those for ventricular fibrillation, but because of the electrical conduction pattern in the heart pathways, an organized signal is provided to the ventricles, potentially allowing them to beat. This remains an emergency, since V-tach may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation.Premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) Every person experiences the occasional palpitation in which the atrium or the ventricle beats early. These premature atrial contractions (PACs) or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are normal variants and most people are unaware of their occurrence. However, some patients report a palpitation in the chest and neck, often described as a \"thump\" or \"thud.\" PACs and PVCs in otherwise healthy individuals do not pose any health risks.",
        "The PSVT can cause the atrium to beat more quickly than it should normally (AFib) Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) occurs when the pathways in the AV node or atrium allow altered conduction of electricity, and the atrium begins firing at a fast but regular rate, sometimes more than 150 to 200 times per minute. The ventricles, sensing the electrical activity coming through the AV node, try to beat along with each electrical impulse and PSVT occurs. This is rarely a life-threatening event, but people may feel uncomfortable when PSVT occurs. They may become lightheaded, weak, have shortness of breath, and describe a feeling of fullness in the throat. PSVT may also be tolerated and may stop on its own. If this is a first-time event, activating EMS (emergency medical services) and calling 9-1-1 is important, since other tachycardias can be life-threatening. The treatment for PSVT includes attempts to stimulate the vagus nerve to slow the heart (see vasovagal syncope above) by holding one's breath and bearing down as if to have a bowel movement. Intravenous medications are often used to interrupt the episode. Many patients have PSVT due to congenital abnormalities in the electrical conduction system of the heart. External causes can include hyperthyroidism, electrolyte imbalances, and the use of caffeine, alcohol, over-the-counter cold medications containing stimulants, or illegal drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine.Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a specific type of PSVT, in which an inborn error of wiring has occurred near the AV node, and an accessory electrical pathway exists. The diagnosis is made by electrocardiogram (EKG) or electrophysiologic testing, and the treatment may include medication or destruction of the accessory electrical pathway by invasive catheter ablation. Aside from medications that are meant to slow the heart for treatment of a variety of medical problems, bradycardia (brady = low + cardia = heart) is usually due to heart block and the aging of the electrical wiring of the heart. This is no different than the aging of your home's electrical system; but instead of being able to rewire the heart, these conditions may need to be treated with an implantable pacemaker.Heart blocks",
        "Heart blocks involving the ventricle may be asymptomatic and of little consequence except to point to underlying heart or lung disease. They are diagnosed by EKG.Heart blocks involving the atrium can be classified as first-, second-, and third-degree.First-degree heart block is common and usually of little significance. There is a slight delay in getting the electrical signal from the SA node to the AV node, but the heart functions normally.There are two types of second-degree heart block (Mobitz I and Mobitz II, with Type II being more serious than Type I.Third-degree heart block describes the complete loss of connection between the electrical activity of the atria and the ventricles. Second- and third-degree heart blocks are diagnosed by analyzing heart rhythm strips and EKGs.Heart blocks are symptomatic because the heart beats so slowly that cardiac output is decreased. The symptoms may include lightheadedness or passing out (syncope), weakness, shortness of breath, and chest pain.Diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening heart block happen at the same time. Often, the patient with bradycardia may be taking medications that can slow the heart including beta blockers and certain calcium channel blockers. If the patient is stable, time can be taken to have the medications wear off while the patient is monitored. If the bradycardia remains, a pacemaker may be needed. In certain situations, a temporary pacemaker can be placed to stabilize the patient, while decisions are made as to a permanent solution.  Unexplained palpitations are not normal, especially when associated with shortness of breath, sweating, feelings of chest pressure, or passing out. The person should be made comfortable and laid flat, and EMS (emergency medical service) should be activated by calling 9-1-1 or the emergency number in your area. If the person is unconscious or unresponsive, Basic life support (American Heart Association) should be initiated. Call 9-1-1, get an AED and decide whether CPR should be initiated.",
        "If the episode is short-lived and resolves spontaneously, the primary care professional should be contacted urgently to seek advice. If the episode is a recurrent problem, the diagnosis is known, and the rhythm disturbance resolves itself, then a less urgent call to the primary care professional is warranted. It is reasonable to seek emergent medical care any time that a heart rhythm disturbance occurs or if there is concern that a heart problem is present.How do doctors diagnose heart rhythm disorders? The mainstay of diagnosis remains the EKG and heart rhythm monitoring. These are often done immediately in the ambulance or upon arrival in the emergency department. In many patients, the palpitations or symptoms may have resolved, and no acute rhythm abnormalities can be found. Depending on the associated symptoms and the history, observation and monitoring of the heart may occur in the hospital or as an outpatient. In patients who have passed out, admission to the hospital often occurs. Those patients with chest pain and shortness of breath may also be admitted to evaluate their hearts. In patients who are not admitted, a heart monitoring device may be placed to monitor the rhythm for a duration of time. Monitors may be worn for 24 hours or up to 1 month. In some instances, rhythm identification is elusive and may take months or years to capture and identify. Implantable cardiac monitors may be placed for periods greater than 1 year. If the rhythm is known, then tests to identify potential causes may be done. These are dependent on the specific rhythm abnormality and can range from blood tests to lung evaluations and sleep studies to echocardiograms and electrophysiologic testing.  There is no one treatment for a heart rhythm abnormality. When the patient is unstable, with no pulse or blood pressure, or when they are unconscious, American Heart Association guidelines are available to direct care to hopefully restore the heart rhythm to normal and return a pulse.",
        "For V-fib and V-tach, electricity may be the most important drug, and the heart is shocked back into a heart rhythm, hopefully, compatible with life. Other common medications used in crisis situations depend upon the life-threatening rhythm and may include epinephrine (adrenalin), atropine, and amiodarone. For patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), the goal is not only to slow down the heart rate but also to identify which rhythm is present. Vasovagal maneuvers, like holding one's breath and bearing down as if to have a bowel movement may resolve the situation, or it may slow the rate temporarily to make the diagnosis. Adenosine can be injected and may convert SVT to normal sinus rhythm by slowing the electrical impulse at the AV node. It can also be used as a diagnostic challenge to help identify atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response. For atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, the initial goal is to slow the rate and maintain normal blood pressure. Calcium channel blockers like diltiazem and beta blockers like metoprolol may be used intravenously to control the rate. Digoxin is a second-line medication that may be helpful when first-line medications fail. In unstable patients, with chest pain, shortness of breath, or decreased consciousness, cardioversion with an electric shock may be required. The decision to electively convert A-fib to normal sinus rhythm depends upon the patient and situation and is often a decision left to the primary care professional. The question regarding anticoagulation also will need to be addressed.  While most heart dysrhythmias can be treated and controlled, ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia can be fatal. Their recognition and treatment are true emergencies, and there is no guarantee that sudden cardiac death can be reversed. For all other rhythm abnormalities, there may be time to make the diagnosis and design a treatment plan. The goal is to minimize the effect that dysrhythmia has on daily activity and quality of life.Is it possible to prevent heart rhythm disorders?",
        "Minimizing risk factors for heart disease will be helpful, including controlling blood pressure, lowering cholesterol, keeping diabetes under control, and not smoking. For those with rapid palpitations that are intermittent, avoiding stimulants like alcohol, caffeine, over-the-counter cold medications, and illicit drugs are important preventive measures.

Living With A-FibAFib symptoms like heart racing, fluttering, and irregular heart beat may be caused by heart disease, obesity, alcohol use, thyroid disease, and other conditions. AFib medications may include blood thinners, drugs to control heart rate or convert the heart to a normal rhythm. AFib surgery is also a treatment possibility. Blood Clots (in the Leg)Blood clots can form in the heart, legs, arteries, veins, bladder, urinary tract, and uterus. Risk factors include high blood pressure and cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, and family history. \r What Is the Difference Between Electrocardiogram and Electrocardiograph?An electrocardiogram or electrocardiograph (ECG or EKG) are the same thing. An EKG is a test that examines the heart function by measuring the electrical activity of the heart. Based on the electrocardiogram, the doctor determines whether the electrical activity of the heart is normal or irregular, aiding in diagnosis of various heart problems. Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)An electrocardiogram is known by the acronyms \"ECG\" or \"EKG\" more commonly used for this noninvasive procedure to record the electrical activity of the heart. An EKG generally is performed as part of a routine physical exam, part of a cardiac exercise stress test, or part of the evaluation of symptoms. Symptoms evaluated include palpitations, fainting, shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, or chest pain. ElectrolytesElectrolytes are substances that become ions in solution and acquire the capacity to conduct electricity. The balance of the electrolytes in our bodies is essential for normal function of our cells and our organs. Common electrolytes include sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. The functions and normal range values for these electrolytes are important, and if an electrolyte is at an extreme low or high, it can be fatal.",

After years of falling output and a diminishing percentage of the labor force, the last few years have seen renewed growth. According to PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the catalysts for this revival include factors such as the strengthening economy, workforce quality, tax policies, the regulatory environment, and transportation and energy costs.1 Yet in order to move forward, it is important to see how American manufacturing compares to that of other nations. In this report, we develop a global manufacturing scorecard that looks at five dimensions of the manufacturing environment: 1) overall policies and regulations; 2) tax policy; 3) energy, transportation, and health costs; 4) workforce quality; and 5) infrastructure and innovation.",
        "For the analysis, we compiled data on 20 indicators and scored 19 leading nations on a 100-point scale. The countries analyzed included Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. The top ranked nations in overall manufacturing environment were the United Kingdom and Switzerland (both with 78 points out of 100), followed by the United States (77 points), Japan (74 points), and Canada (74 points). We found these nations performed well due to their policies, cost considerations, workforce investments, and infrastructure. At the low end were nations such as Brazil (51 points), Indonesia (53 points), Mexico (56 points), Russia (56 points), and India (57 points). Generally, these places do not have advantageous tax policies and are not making adequate investments in education or infrastructure. In addition, we compiled data on manufacturing output, manufacturing employment, and changes overtime. China is the top nation in terms of manufacturing output and the percentage of its national output that is generated by that sector. Poland meanwhile has the highest percentage of its workforce employed in manufacturing, followed by Germany, Italy, Turkey, and South Korea. China is the top nation in terms of manufacturing output and the percentage of its national output that is generated by that sector. Poland meanwhile has the highest percentage of its workforce employed in manufacturing. There have been important changes over the past few decades in country rankings based on manufacturing output. Most nations show fairly stable patterns over the past 40 years, but a few have increased their performance. One such example is India, which improved its output ranking from 14th in 1990 to sixth in 2015. In contrast, Spain had dropped in manufacturing performance from ninth in 2005 to 14th in 2015. The same is true for Russia, as it was ranked second in manufacturing output in 1980 but now has dropped to 15th in the world.",
        "Based on our analysis, we make a number of recommendations for improving the manufacturing environment. Our suggestions include: Pursue a governance strategy that emphasizes political and economic predictability, and open trade policies. Developing policies that provide access to global markets and facilitate technology diffusion will help the manufacturing sector. Provide the proper financial incentives to promote innovation, education, and workforce development. This includes R&D tax credits and equipment expensing tax credits that help companies overcome the fixed costs of production and distribution. Additionally, providing grants and loans to domestic manufacturers can aid in the growth of businesses and their technology innovation. Unlock 21st century tools such as Big Data, automation, and artificial intelligence. These forms of technology have the capacity to revolutionize manufacturing from the initial design of goods to the successful delivery of products. Help small firms through technology research and workforce development. Technology development and its diffusion into the manufacturing sector leads to the creation of higher paying jobs, and workers with more developed skills. Rules that encourage transparency of business practice help to alleviate corruption and its damaging ripple effects. Whistleblower protection and investing in detection capabilities can aid in weakening the roots of corruption. Finance the necessary physical and digital infrastructure to support business development. Physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, dams, and ports are necessary to connect supply chains as is the deployment of digital infrastructure such as high-speed broadband and mobile technology. The creation of adequate infrastructure helps companies operate efficiently and grow overtime. China leads the world in terms of manufacturing output, with over $2.01 trillion in output (see Table 1). This is followed by the United States ($1.867 trillion), Japan ($1.063 trillion), Germany ($700 billion), and South Korea ($372 billion). Manufacturing constitutes 27 percent of China\u2019s overall national output, which accounts for 20 percent of the world\u2019s manufacturing output. In the United States, it represents 12 percent of the nation\u2019s output and 18 percent of the world\u2019s capacity. In Japan, manufacturing is 19 percent of the country\u2019s national output and 10 percent of the world total. Overall, China, the United States, and Japan comprise 48 percent of the world\u2019s manufacturing output.",
        "Poland is the leading country in terms of the percentage of its population employed in manufacturing (see Table 2). A total of 20.2 percent is employed there, followed by Germany (19 percent), Italy (18.5 percent), Turkey (18.1 percent), South Korea (16.9 percent), China (16.9 percent), and Japan (16.9 percent). About 10.5 percent of the American workforce is employed in manufacturing. There have been significant shifts in manufacturing employment between 1970 and 2011 (see Table 3). In developed countries, manufacturing comprised 16.8 percent of the workforce in 1970, but only 12.8 percent in 2011. In contrast, several regions have increased their focus on manufacturing. For example, manufacturing in East Asia (including China and South Korea) totaled 13.9 percent of the workforce in 1970, but 21.5 percent in 2011. Southeast Asia went from 11.4 percent in 1970 to 14 percent in 2011. India increased from 9.4 percent in 1970 to 11.6 percent in 2011. Most countries have been fairly stable in their manufacturing output over the past few decades, but there have been some shifts since 1970. For example, in 1970, the top countries were the United States, USSR, Japan, Germany, China, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Canada (see Table 4). However, by 2015, the leaders had shifted to China, the United States, Japan, Germany, South Korea, India, Italy, the United Kingdom, and France. Table 4: Changes in country rank ordering on manufacturing output, 1970-2015 During this time period, one nation that improved considerably is India. It raised its output ranking from 14th in 1990 to sixth in 2015. In contrast, Spain dropped in manufacturing performance from ninth in 2005 to 14th in 2015. The same is true for Russia, as it was ranked second in manufacturing output in 1980 but now has dropped to 15th in the world. One of the important determinants of how countries perform is their overall manufacturing environment. To assess this, we looked at five dimensions of the overall environment: policies and regulations; tax policy; energy, transportation, and health costs; workforce quality; and infrastructure and innovation (see Appendix for details on measures and information sources).",
        "Based on 20 indicators, we developed a 100-point scale to rank countries on their manufacturing environment. The top-ranked nations were the United Kingdom and Switzerland. For overall policies, we included indicators on pro-business environment, a risk index, corruption, and open trade policies. With tax policies, we looked at corporate tax rates, use of R&D tax credit and expensing options, and government grants or loans to support manufacturing. On costs, we examined electricity, oil/LNG, and health care costs. Workforce quality included measures on K-12 government spending, higher education spending, family income, labor productivity, and labor support. On infrastructure and innovation, we relied upon infrastructure spending as a percent of GDP, internet access, patent filings, R&D spending as a percent of GDP, and hazard exposure. Based on these 20 indicators, we developed a 100-point scale to rank countries on their manufacturing environment. Table 5 shows that the top nations included the United Kingdom (a score of 78), Switzerland (78), the United States (77), Japan (74), Canada (74), and the Netherlands (74). At the low end of our scale were Brazil (a score of 51), Indonesia, (53), Mexico (56), Russia, (56), and India (57). These countries lagged the other examined nations on a number of different dimensions. Table 6 lists the detailed breakdowns of our 20 indicators for each nation. This table shows how each country fared on these measures for the five dimensions. As an illustration, the United Kingdom garnered top scores for its pro-business environment, risk index, lack of corruption, and corporate tax policies, but lower marks on infrastructure, patent filings, and higher education spending. This was in contrast to Brazil, which did not perform well on its business environment, tax policies, higher education spending, infrastructure, and patent filings. Those issues limit the country\u2019s output and productivity, and act as a drag on economic prosperity.",
        "In looking at the nations that did well on our manufacturing index, we found that they took manufacturing seriously and had a number of policies conducive to developing that sector. We look at three different countries (the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the United States) to see what they are doing to help manufacturing. The United Kingdom\u2019s manufacturing industry has been strengthened recently by the drop in the value of the British pound against the U.S. dollar and the euro, thereby facilitating an increased demand overseas for U.K. goods. Beyond the currency angle, though, manufacturing there retains a strong presence because of its important role in the export economy. Although the sector only contributes 10 percent to the nation\u2019s GDP, it comprises 44 percent of U.K.\u2019s exports. Over 70 percent of all U.K. manufacturers believe that conditions are right for improving export growth and 76 percent of manufacturers in the U.K. have a strategy they believe will help their business grow overseas. The U.K. provides tax incentives that facilitate excellent manufacturing research and development. In the medium to long term, the U.K.\u2019s strength in manufacturing aims to capture a larger proportion of overseas market. This is promising as 89 percent of manufacturers say they seek to build long-term customer loyalty overseas.2 Of course, one drawback of the weak pound is it increases import costs for certain supplies. National leaders will have to keep their eye on that fact in order to keep costs reasonable for production. The U.K. provides tax incentives that facilitate excellent manufacturing research and development. The U.K. scored highly in each of the categories under tax policy and the country is known for its expertise in manufacturing R&D. Specifically, the automotive industry and aerospace industry in the U.K. are world-class. Contrary to the general trend across Europe, the automotive industry has achieved record growth and the country is positioned to hit an annual production target of two million vehicles by 2021.3 Fifty percent of all automobiles built in the U.K. are exported, 2,000 companies are involved in its automotive sector, and 18 out of the 20 largest automotive suppliers are located within the country as well.",
        "Ninety percent of all aerospace goods made in the U.K. are exported, and the industry is anticipated to grow in the U.K. by a rate of 6.8 percent for the coming years. The industry is well positioned as some of the most intricate aerospace parts like wings, engines, avionics, and systems for civil aircrafts are made within the country.4 Though the U.K.\u2019s success in manufacturing can largely be attributed to their expertise in aerospace and automotive industries, it is important to note this success hinges on open trade policies. As Brexit negotiations unfold, the future of the industry likely will experience considerable turbulence if free-trade is stifled in any major way through rules or tariffs. Switzerland\u2019s strong manufacturing industry has been helped by its effective governance policies. The country has transparent and fair processes, strong judicial effectiveness, and considerable economic and political stability due to its long-held international neutrality. Although the Swiss franc is currently a very strong currency, there is very little currency inconvertibility or transfer restriction risk and investors are free to convert and transfer funds in and out of Switzerland without the fear of restrictive policies. Additionally, Switzerland prioritizes being a strong trading country; the combined value of imports and exports equals 114 percent of its GDP and its applied tariff rate averages 0 percent.5 Coupled with a low corporate tax rate, these policies lay down the groundwork for a very successful manufacturing base as investors maintain confidence in the business climate. Although Swiss costs of production and a strong franc do pose some risks, the country has capitalized on its workforce advantages as well as its stable political environment to build one of the strongest manufacturing industries in the world. The workforce talent and manufacturing quality in Switzerland are top-flight. The country has a large stock of highly skilled workers, and the value-add to their economy through their manufacturing industry is one of the highest in the world. Because their economy is developed and stable, they are home to some of the biggest pharmaceutical and computer product giants globally such as Novartis and Hoffman-La Roche. According to Bloomberg\u2019s Innovation Index, Switzerland\u2019s pharmaceutical manufacturing industry and computer and electronics industry respectively added $27.02 billion and $26.96 billion in gross revenue.6 Although Swiss costs of production and a strong franc do pose some risks, the country has capitalized on its workforce advantages as well as its stable political environment to build one of the strongest manufacturing industries in the world.",
        "The United States manufacturing sector has benefited from a talented workforce, advanced technology, and pro-business policies. American manufacturing drives 35 percent of productivity growth, 60 percent of exports, and 70 percent of private sector R&D.7 Additionally, manufacturers contributed $2.17 trillion to the United States economy which is nearly 12.1 percent of the U.S. GDP.8 Although labor costs in the United States are significantly higher than other countries, the levels of productivity found in the United States make up for this difference and have made the country an attractive location for manufacturing investment. Moreover, the gap in labor costs found in the United States in comparison to other countries has started to drop and likely will continue to drop as the cost of industrial robots falls. Disruptive technologies like additive manufacturing, 3D-printing, advanced robotics, and the utilization of the Internet of Things and Big Data are revolutionizing U.S. manufacturing.9 This has not only increased levels of productivity but has also made the United States one of the most attractive locations for high-technology manufacturing firms. John Deere, for example, has added sensors to some of its models and the company sells the data retrieved from these sensors to farmers in order to offer new insights and improve agricultural practices. The U.S. has, until recently, benefited from open trade policies. For manufacturing growth to continue, the country should avoid tariff wars or overly restricted trade policies. The development of programs like the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) represent some of the biggest drivers in this advanced technology development. NNMI brings together manufacturers, university engineering schools, federal agencies, non-profit organizations, and regional organizations to invest in novel manufacturing technology. Nine manufacturing innovation institutes that are funded by the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy are a part of NNMI and their research areas cover technology developments from 3D printing to lightweight metals manufacturing.[10] Other incentives programs like grants from the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) help accelerate the growth of advanced manufacturing in the country.10",
        "Advanced manufacturing technology development can be found throughout the United States. In Indiana for example, Rolls Royce, which makes jet engines, employs thousands of engineers. Zimmer Biomet makes surgical products in Warsaw, Indiana, a city that has become a national hub for orthopedic products.11 The United States has, until recently, benefited from open trade policies, and in order for manufacturing growth to continue, the country should avoid tariff wars or overly restricted trade policies. Canada and Mexico bought one fifth of all U.S. manufactured goods in 201612 and nearly half of the manufactured goods made in the United States were exported to countries with whom the United States has free trade agreements.13 Moving forward, it is vital for American leaders to continue the policies that have helped the recent resurgence of the manufacturing sector. In this section, we examine several countries that did not perform very well on our index, looking at what problems they face and how their policies inhibit manufacturing development. We discuss the low-performing countries of Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico to discern the barriers to manufacturing output. Brazil\u2019s flailing manufacturing sector can be attributed at least in part to the corruption that has plagued the country. Generally speaking, corruption makes investors fearful of pouring money into business operations in a country because of long-term uncertainty, and this in turn dampens prospects for long term investment and business growth. This fear is warranted in the case of Brazil as the amount of money lost due to corruption continues to rise. Petrobas, Brazil\u2019s state owned oil company, is alone estimated to have cost the country more than 5 billion dollars in paybacks.14 Moreover, the manufacturing sector in Brazil is specifically implicated by this nation-wide corruption. That sector is responsible for 60 percent of the country\u2019s exports. Fifty-seven percent of the foreign bribery cases in Brazil from 1999 to 2014 were found in the manufacturing, extractives, construction, and transport sectors.15",
        "A healthy manufacturing sector is contingent upon transparency in financial transactions, relative certainty in a future a country\u2019s political environment, and individuals being held accountable for illegal action. Brazil\u2019s \u201cOperation Car Wash\u201d has revealed some of the illegal dealings that have taken place in the country, but there are several holes that need to be filled or else there exists a very real possibility this corruption will never be completely eliminated. Companies have hired compliance teams over the past two years16 and Brazil\u2019s Clean Companies Act has started a movement in the right direction, but improved whistleblower protection and detection and enforcement capabilities are necessary in order to establish a framework that stymies corruption. A healthy manufacturing sector is contingent upon transparency in financial transactions, relative certainty in a future a country\u2019s political environment, and individuals being held accountable for illegal action. Every country seeking to improve their manufacturing sector should decrease corruption because Brazil has shown how the ripple effects of such corruption hampers manufacturing growth. A decade ago, Indonesia\u2019s manufacturing industry contributed 27.4 percent to its GDP. In the third quarter of 2017, this figure dropped to 21 percent, which was the lowest percentage since 2000.17 Our breakdown of the country\u2019s manufacturing environment shows the limits of its workforce. Specifically, Indonesia is hampered by anemic labor productivity. Its manufacturing industry has been described as having a \u201cmissing middle,\u201d meaning that its large proportion of small and unproductive firms is dragging down the entire sector.18 In order to become more globally competitive, Indonesia needs to develop its workforce and advance its manufacturing sector. Its leaders should incentivize manufacturing firms with low productivity to either exit the industry or improve their productivity through technology and higher skilled labor. The existence of unproductive manufacturing firms can be partially explained by low wages in Indonesia. The availability of low-paid workers makes firms complacent, and consequently these firms are not incentivized to upgrade skills of their workers or innovate their technology. That limits the entire sector.1920",
        "In addition to improving wages, Indonesia must strengthen its worker training. Airlangga Hartarto, Indonesia\u2019s minister of industry, has already established the framework for policies designed to bring about this improvement. The minister has said he plans to provide tax incentives for vocation programs to improve training, encourage manufacturers to make innovative products, and get manufacturers to focus on exports.21 The country\u2019s \u201cIndustry 4.0\u201d plan seeks to improve its global competitiveness through technologies such as automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence. Finally, Indonesia needs to improve its infrastructure and traffic flow. A survey of small manufacturing industries has shown that congestion problems and logistics performance problems rooted in poor infrastructure represent substantial constraints for manufacturing plants. By developing more infrastructure in the country, Indonesia would reap benefits like more skilled workers and technology diffusion from international corporations establishing branches in Indonesia. Although Mexico\u2019s manufacturing sector has in many ways surpassed pre-NAFTA expectations, the country still experiences stagnant labor productivity and scores as one of the worst countries in this category. In the 1960s and 1970s, Mexico\u2019s productivity grew at a rate of four percent per year, but in the past 10 years, this figure has dropped to around 0.8 percent per year. This low labor productivity acts as a major drag on economic growth and societal prosperity. Despite this limitation, Mexico is a very strong exporter and 36 percent of its GDP comes from merchandise exports. That is one of the highest rates in Latin America.22 In a recent Moody\u2019s Analytics study, Abhilasha Singh and Jesse Rogers note that the shortage of formal jobs in Mexico has motivated the creation of informal work arrangements throughout the country. Although the productivity at large manufacturing firms in Mexico has improved due to technology innovation and the pressure of keeping up with the competitive, global market, these firms only constitute a third of total employment in the country. Smaller firms, which often engage in the use of informal employment, have declined in productivity at a rate of two percent from 2004 to 2014.",
        "Although Mexico\u2019s manufacturing sector has in many ways surpassed pre-NAFTA expectations, the country still experiences stagnant labor productivity. Another factor contributing to productivity problems is poor education in Mexico. Although our evaluation of Mexico\u2019s K-12 and higher education spending is around average in comparison to the other countries in this study, this money is not spent efficiently or effectively. The average Mexican has only 10 years of formal education, which is below average for an OECD country and lower than other Latin American countries. Because of the low average level of education, Mexicans often cannot fill vacancies that require technical expertise in larger manufacturing firms and are forced to engage in low-skill occupations. As a result, developing vocational training policies and policies that incentivize high school graduation and university enrollment are crucial for Mexico\u2019s future. The country should seek to integrate small manufacturing firms with their informal labor into the formal economy. Providing greater incentives for the domestic development of technology would help these smaller and medium sized firms increase their margins and boost their productivity. In addition, upgrading Mexico\u2019s infrastructure would increase the productivity of smaller manufacturing plants. Production chains that require materials from outside the immediate area are often stifled by extra costs due to poor connectivity between cities.23 The development of infrastructure is critical for large manufacturing firms as well, as it is estimated that by 2020, bottlenecks at the ports of Veracruz and Lazaro Cardenas could cause delays to as much as 25 percent of the shipments from Mexico to the United States.24 Lastly, working on corruption and bringing down the prevalence of crime in the country should be prioritized as well. The cost of crime in Mexico is estimated to add two-to-three percent to the cost of doing business. Small firms bear the brunt of corruption as they find it harder to hire security and ward off extortion attempts.25",
        "Based on our analysis, we make a number of recommendations for improving the manufacturing sector. We discuss them in the section below. Pursue a governance strategy that emphasizes political and economic stability, and open trade policies  Economic and political stability alongside open trade policies are necessary for investors and industry leaders. Having a positive environment for conducting business facilitates manufacturing and overall economic growth. It is vital to have trade policies that provide access to global markets and encourage technology diffusion in the production of goods. When a nation is known to be economically and politically stable, many advanced manufacturing industries with high fixed costs are more willing to set up shop even if the cost of doing so is higher than in other countries. When a nation is known to be economically and politically stable, many advanced manufacturing industries with high fixed costs are more willing to set up shop\u2014even if the cost of doing so is higher than in other countries. Creating an environment conducive to stability requires respect for the rule of law, protecting property rights, enforcing contracts, and mitigating the risks of corruption. These features encourage foreign direct investment and lead to technologically advanced companies wanting to do business in-country. Provide the proper financial incentives to improve the workforce and overall productivity  Developing financial incentives that include a low corporate tax rate, R&D tax credits, government grants, and government loans can help countries improve their manufacturing sectors. Increased productivity results from technological development, but often times high initial fixed costs operate as financial barriers that preclude the ability to develop these sorts of disruptive and transformative technologies. By providing these incentives to domestic manufacturers, the growth of businesses and their respective technologies can take place. The entrance of new firms induces greater competitiveness and encourages innovation in general.",
        "Unlock 21st century technology such as Big Data, automation, and artificial intelligence  For economically advanced countries, competing on the cost-side of production is very difficult. In order for these countries to keep their manufacturing sectors flourishing, value unlocked through robots, artificial intelligence, and the use of Big Data is essential. As the cost of developing robots decreases and as efficiency is increased through Big Data and artificial intelligence, these countries can retain their place as manufacturing powerhouses. Public-private partnerships and government sponsored initiatives can assist the continual development of 21st century innovations. For economically advanced countries to keep their manufacturing sectors flourishing, value unlocked through robots, artificial intelligence, and the use of Big Data is essential. Our case studies have demonstrated that manufacturing industries as a whole are being hamstrung in many places by small, inefficient firms. Increasing scale would force small firms to innovate their processes and increase productivity. Having more advanced technologies requires workers with the skills necessary to work in these new, more-productive industries. Many medium- and large-sized firms have job openings, but have difficulty finding the skilled workers they need due to a lack of formal education. Vocational training programs and education focused on incentivizing individuals to study in STEM fields is imperative. In addition, officials should help small businesses learn how to navigate global supply chains and export rules. As pointed out by Jared Bernstein and Somin Park, \u201ccustomized services for small- and medium-sized manufacturers help them to overcome financing and information barriers, improve their technology and product design, and link them up to global supply chains.\u201d26 Setting up one-stop places for small firms to access expertise and understand how to build trade is a great way to boost manufacturing. Corruption functions as a disincentive for manufacturing investment in some countries. The risk of money being taken by the host government outweighs the cheap labor costs that can be found in that country. Additionally, because of the ripple effects of corruption, different portions of the supply chain are subject to instantaneous breakdown which can cost companies astronomically. Legislation that mandates the transparency of business practice can help to alleviate corruption. More whistleblower protection and better detection capabilities can assist in reducing corruption. Encouraging more compliance and audit personnel can help in creating a culture of accountability and performance.",
        "Developing the physical and digital infrastructures for businesses to operate is something almost all countries\u2019 manufacturing sectors require. Physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports, etc., are necessary to connect supply chains in more efficient ways and to export products. The same is true for high-speed broadband and mobile technology. Small manufacturing firms often cite congestion, logistical, or connectivity problems as major barriers to overcome. As developing economies look to export more, increased transportation infrastructure investment is necessary in order to reach global markets. Small manufacturing firms often cite congestion, logistical, or connectivity problems as major barriers to overcome. As developing economies look to export more, increased transportation infrastructure investment is necessary in order to reach global markets. Moreover, countries that already have sound transportation infrastructures need efficient supply chains. One cannot have high-performing manufacturing companies without adequate infrastructure. We looked at five dimensions of the manufacturing environment: overall policies and regulations; tax policy; energy, transportation, and health costs; workforce quality; and infrastructure and innovation. Across these dimensions, we compiled data on 20 indicators and scored them on a five point scale. This yields a total possibility of 100 points.

In order to determine oil and natural gas costs, we took the value of oil and natural gas imported for each country in 2015 based on TradeMap data. In order to take account of the cost of domestic production, we took the cost of how much it takes to drill one barrel of oil in each country on average based on Knoema information, multiplied this cost by how many million barrels were drilled a day, and multiplied this number by 365 to come out with the cost of domestic oil production that takes place in a year. Because not all of this oil drilled domestically ends up being consumed domestically, we subtracted the value of total oil exported for each country in 2015. This number was divided by its respective country\u2019s GDP in order to come out with a number that described a country\u2019s oil and natural gas costs as a percentage of its GDP.
